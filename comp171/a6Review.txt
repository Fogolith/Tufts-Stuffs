For this assignment, Steve and I met to plan out our work. I handled updates to the HTML/CSS/JS code for the prototype and Steve wrote up the questionnaire 
after we discussed what to add. We conducted the usability tests together so
that we could discuss our observations immediately after. We wrote up our 
conclusions together before submitting the assignment.
