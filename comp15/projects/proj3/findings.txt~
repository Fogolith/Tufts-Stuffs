adjusting for legs (scorpion octapus)

min constricts set growth, avg allows for greatest set flexibility, max promotes diversity within sets (not always good for clustering)

number of clusters has little difference in clustering patterns when changing between min/max, max branches sets out early and so develops strange combinations (especially when small sets with 3-6 members begin merging) avg gave overall more coherent sets (didn't have outliers as a result of inner set micro-diversity)

increasing number of clusters obviously gives most coherent sets, apparent that at lower and lower numbers classes of animals are forced to merge together (mammals with fish, birds with insects and mollusks)
