Findings:

Firstly, it is obviously beneficial to have more lanes in the interest of reducing wait time. Configuration 2 (with 4 lanes) will ALWAYS yield a shorter average wait time, and additional lanes would lower it still.

The express simulation (replacing 2 of the 4 lanes with express-only lanes) works well on sets of customers in which few customers have many items - by lumping all "slow" customers into 2 lanes, wait time can be drastically reduced for express customers, though it increases average wait time. Furthermore, customers with just over 5 items may experience drastic wait times when in line behind a customer with many items. Assuming that "fairness" would be that a customer's wait time is proportional to their number of items, the arrangements is fair to express customers and customers with A LOT of items, but grossly unfair to those just over express capacity. 

The bank example provides the lowest average wait time of all configurations. Like the minimart, express customers are given no benefits. Splitting the line to four registers allows the entire waiting populous to split the wait but, unlike the minimart, the multiple registers prevent clogging. Only when all four registers are occupied by item-heavy customers will the whole line be slowed down, and so long as some of the registers open the line moves smoothly. 


Probably the best way to reduce wait time and improve the simulation would be to add a queue that manages customers with many items. Some threshhold, probably above the average number of items (say, 40), could separate "slow" customers into their own lanes. They would have little wait time (unless multiple customers with many items showed up in a short time span) and creating multiple lanes would further reduce their wait time. This way, express customers are given their preference, and customers that would otherwise hold back the non-express lanes are handled on their own. Adding more lanes, and having more for high-item customers, would take the waiting burden off of the low-cost customers that do not qualify for express.
