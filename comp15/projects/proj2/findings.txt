Project 2 Findings

a)Because some non-terminals may genererate themselves (Noun Adj Noun or NP 
Prep NP), probability dictates that every so often a very long sentence will 
be generated based on which rules are chosen, considering that rules are 
selected at random. If NP produces "Prep NP" several times and then produces 
"Det Noun",and Noun produces "Adj Noun" multiple times, a sentence with 
multiple prepositions, adjectives and nouns may be created (e.g. the professor 
under the bathtub with the bathtub under every dog in every boring sandwich..).

b)In my design, each terminal added to a non-terminals vector of words creates
a new "words" rule -- a rule that dictates the return of a random word. The 
greater the number of nouns in any given grammar, the less likely that
an adjective will be placed in front of a noun, exponentially reducing the 
chances that multiple adjectives will be produced in sequence. 
 
c)In my program, if the same rule is entered multiple times for some non
terminal it will be stored multiple times. Likewise, if the same terminal is 
added multiple times it will be stored multiple times, increacing its chances 
of being selected at random. In this way, the relative frequencies of rules 
entered should be reflected in sentence production.
