Project 2 Findings

Because some non-terminals may genererate themselves (Noun Adj Noun or NP Prep
 NP), probability dictates that every so often a very long sentence will be 
generated based on which rules are chosen, considering that rules are selected
at random. If NP produces "Prep NP" several times and then produces "Det Noun",
and Noun produces "Adj Noun" multiple times, a sentence with multiple 
prepositions, adjectives and nouns may be created.
