On this assignment I worked with Andrew Jang and Ian Mcconnel, with 
collaboration from Kamden Segawa. I spent roughly 4 hours on part a, 2 hours
on part b, 3 hours on part c, 12 hours on part d, and 1 hour on part e for a
total of 20 hours. The order in which to complete the subproblems of part d
was poorly formed, but the assignment covered a satisfying breadth overall.
